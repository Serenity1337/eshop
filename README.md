This is a personal E-SHOP project mostly focusing on react. The template was inspired by wix.com. It uses a fake database and no backend at all. It has register,login, cart functionalities.
The way to run this:

You need 2 terminals:

1. To run the fake database you use: npm run start:server
2. To run the frontend on your localhost you use: npm run start
